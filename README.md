Jujutsu Kaisen 0[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. The manga, which was originally titled Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School,[b] was serialized in Shueisha's magazine Jump GIGA from April to July 2017. After Akutami launched Jujutsu Kaisen in 2018, the series was retroactively retitled Jujutsu Kaisen 0—making it a prequel—and released in a single tankōbon volume in December 2018. It was licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. The series follows Yuta Okkotsu, a young student who becomes a sorcerer and seeks to control the cursed spirit of his childhood friend Rika Orimoto.

Akutami wrote the series with no themes to follow but wanted to write and draw cool-looking characters. They were often supported by their two editors while writing the manga. The manga was a commercial success in both Japan and North America. Critical response to the manga was generally positive; several reviewers praised Yuta's role and his relationship with Rika. Critics found Yuta more compelling than Jujutsu Kaisen's Yuji Itadori who, while having several similarities with Yuta, has different characterizations. The relationships of the main cast were also well-received and the manga's artwork was praised.

Jujutsu Kaisen 0 received an anime film adaptation by MAPPA, which was directed by Sunghoo Park and premiered in Japan in December 2021. It was followed by a novelization and a new gag chapter written by Akutami.
